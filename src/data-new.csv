1;Kapelbrücke;"The Kapellbrücke was built around 1365. It was part of the city's defensive ring and a pedestrian connection between the large city and the small town. In the 17th century, the bridge was adorned with triangular paintings that tell the history of Switzerland and the legends of Lucerne's patron saints St. Leodegar and St. Mauritius. The two bridgeheads were set back after the construction of pavements on the banks of the Reuss River in the 19th century, shortening the bridge from the original 285 to just over 200 meters. On August 18, 1993, at night, a fire broke out on the Kapellbrücke, destroying about two-thirds of the bridge's superstructure as well as most of the panels from the painting cycle.";8.307567284;47.051817;01_F2a_BRUECKEN_24_01-01-D.jpeg,01_F2a_ANLASS_EREIGNIS_0386-01-ak-r-D.jpeg;"Photographer unknown, ca. 1895, F2a/BRÜCKEN/24.01.01| Photo: Heller, Ruswil, 1993, F2a/ANLASS/EREIGNIS/0386"
2;Löwendenkmal;"The Löwendenkmal shows a dying lion (6 by 10 meters), with Latin inscriptions and set within a landscaped park. It was unveiled in Lucerne in 1821. The art piece was designed by one of the most famous sculptors of the time, Danish artist Bertel Thorvaldsen, in Rome. The colossal sculpture was carved into the rock of a former quarry by stonemason Lukas Ahorn from Constance. The initiator, Carl Pfyffer von Altishofen, intended this anti-revolutionary monument to commemorate the dramatic events of August 10, 1792, in Paris, when an enraged mob killed hundreds of Swiss mercenaries, who served as the royal guard of French King Louis XVI, during the storming of the royal palace (the Storming of the Tuileries).";8.310908389;47.05848067;02_F2a_ANLAGEN_24_01-07-ak-r-D.jpeg,02_F2a_ANLAGEN_24_01-01-D.jpeg;"Photographer unknown, ca. 1900, F2a/ANLAGEN/24.01:07| Photo: Fr.

3;Spreuerbrücke;"The southern half of the Spreuerbrücke, built in 1408, stands at right angles to the Reuss. The bridge is adorned with triangular paintings that were painted by Caspar Meglinger in the 17th century. They show the 'Danse Macabre' or 'Dance of Death,' reminding pedestrians of their mortality. The English amateur painter Constance Mary Hemsworth (1869-1940) was so enthusiastic about the Spreuerbrücke during her visit to Lucerne that she had it faithfully reproduced in the large garden of her estate after her return. It is on display in Monk Fryston in North Yorkshire, England.";8.301662197;47.05190875;03_F2_PA_039-321-D.jpeg;"Engraver: Roth, ca. 1750, F2 PA 39/321"
4;Museggmauer;"The Museggmauer is the last remaining part of Lucerne's medieval city fortification. When Lucerne became a city around 1220, construction of the inner ring of walls began, and it was probably completed by the end of the 13th century. By the early 15th century, the construction of the Kapellbrücke (around 1365) and the second ring of walls with the Museggmauer (ca. 1370–1408) and the Sentimauer were completed. The city wall not only served to protect against unwanted intruders or attacks, but also functioned as a legal border, status symbol, and an expression of urban supremacy. Until 1835, city guards collected gate tolls at Basler Tor and Weggistor—a source of income. Today, nine of the original 30 towers are still preserved.";8.305463097;47.0548424;04_F2a_BEFESTIGUNGSWERKE_10_01-01-D.jpeg;"Photographer unknown, ca. 1920, F2a/BEFESTIGUNGSWERKE/10.01:01"
5;Jesuitenkirche;"The Jesuitenkirche was built as a school church for the Jesuit College and for the general pastoral work of the Jesuits. The Jesuit Fathers arrived in Lucerne in 1574 and began operating the school in 1576. On the feast day of St. Francis Xavier (1506–1552), on December 3, 1666, the foundation stone was laid, and on August 29, 1677, the new church was consecrated by papal nuncio Edoardo Cibo.";8.305090474;47.05082628;05_F2a_BAHNHOFSTRASSE_11a_01-01-D.jpeg;"Photo: Niklaus Hinder, Luzern ca. 1890, F2a/STRASSEN/BAHNHOFSTRASSE/11a01:01"
6;Rathaus;"The Rathausturm, originally built in 1504, served as a watch and observation tower rather than being directly integrated into the city's fortifications. Beyond its defensive function, it housed important civic archives, serving as a symbol of legal security and inner peace in the city. Throughout its history, the Rathausturm was painted and redecorated several times. Between 1504 and 1924, it had various painted appearances, including a notable 1863 version.";8.306076268;47.0520712;06_F2a_KORNMARKT_03_01_01-02-D.jpeg;"Photographer unknown, ca. 1863, F2a/STRASSEN/KORNMARKT/03.01.01:02"
7;Nadelwehr;"The Nadelwehr was built between 1859 and 1861. To this day, the water level of Lake Lucerne is manually controlled by removing or inserting so-called 'needles' (wooden planks). One needle weighs 35 kg and measures 3.5 meters. Thanks to this regulation, the lake's water level can be kept at an optimal height for the season, preventing both flooding and low water levels.";8.303240311;47.05133083;07_F2a_WASSERBAUTEN_26-07-p-D.jpeg;"Photographer unknown, ca. 1888, F2a/WASSERBAUTEN/26:07"
8;Lederturm;"The Lederturm was first mentioned in 1392. This tower was named after the neighboring Ledergasse, where Lucerne's leather was tanned. On May 25, 1849, the city of Lucerne demolished the last remains of the tower. The former detention prison had become obsolete and no longer fit the image of a modern city opening itself to the lake and welcoming its first wave of tourists.";8.308360838;47.05404102;08_F2a_BEFESTIGUNGSWERKE_19-dr-D002.jpeg;"Painter: Xaver Schwegler, 1846, F2a/Befestigungswerke/19:01"
9;Burgerturm;"The Burgerturm was first mentioned in records in 1371. It was part of the city fortifications on the left bank of Lucerne and was known as the 'Moosturm' in the 14th century. The Burgertor (Burgers' Gate) opened to the west, leading to the bridge over the Krienbach stream. From 1597 to 1856, the Burgerturm served as a prison for minor offenses. In 1785, it was fitted with a public clock.";8.302924146;47.05029757;09_F2a_PFISTERGASSE_0-05-D.jpeg;"Photo: Charles Mahler, ca. 1860, F2a/STRASSEN/PFISTERGASSE 0.05"
10;Kesselturm;"The Kesselturm was built in the 13th century and marked the southern corner point of Lucerne's city fortification. It housed the majority of prisoners. The leader of the Freischaren, Dr. Jakob Robert Steiger, was imprisoned in this tower in 1845 after participating in the Freischarenzüge, a precursor to the Swiss Civil War of 1847 (Sonderbundskrieg). The tower was demolished in 1857. On the site, the Krienbach schoolhouse was built as the city's first school building.";8.302472353;47.04994056;10_F2a_BEFESTIGUNGSWERKE_17-01-D.jpeg;"Lithograph: A. Rothweiler, ca. 1845, F2a/BEFESTIGUNGSWERKE/17:01"
11;Hofbrücke;"The Hofbrücke was built in the 13th century. The 385-meter-long bridge connected the city with the collegiate church of St. Leodegar, the Hofkirche. It led over flat marshland and served mainly as a church path. The bridge was adorned with framed triangular paintings that depict events from the Old and New Testament of the Bible. The bridge was demolished in the 19th century to open Lucerne to the lake. The paintings were stored in magazines or used as art objects in public buildings. Today they are kept by the city's monument preservation department. The bank was filled up, and the current Schweizerhofquai was built.";8.309234655;47.05367999;11_F2a_VEDUTEN_110-D.jpeg,11_F2a_VEDUTEN_112-D.jpeg;"Lithograph: Isidore Deroy, 1840s, F2a/VEDUTEN/ANSICHTEN/110| Engraving: Johann Jakob Meyer, ca. 1820, F2a/VEDUTEN/ANSICHTEN/112"
12;Brünigbahnhof;"In the second half of the 19th century, the face of the city of Lucerne changed rapidly. The city was connected to the railway network. In 1859, Lucerne received its first train station on the left shore of the lake. Half a century later, the railway tracks were turned southwest, freeing up space for urban expansion in what is now the Neustadt area. The monumental station building was finally opened in 1896, and the Lucerne–Immensee feeder line for the Gotthard Railway was inaugurated in 1897—15 years after the opening of the Gotthard Railway itself. On February 5, 1971, the station building burned down almost completely. After the fire, railway operations continued in temporary buildings until the new station opened in 1985. The station square was completely redesigned, with the old main portal from 1896 and the Zeitgeist figure by Richard Kissling being placed in the middle.";8.310328712;47.05057512;12_F2a_BAHNHOFPLATZ_01_01-01-D.jpeg,12_F2a_BAHNHOFPLATZ_01_02-04-D.jpeg,12_F2a_BAHNHOFPLATZ_01_04-02-D.jpeg;"Brünigbahnhof, photographer unknown, ca. 1890, F2a/BAHNHOFPLATZ/01.01:01| Bahnhof Zentralbahn, photographer unknown, ca. 1880, F2a/BAHNHOFPLATZ/01.02:04| SBB Bahnhof, painter unknown, 1896, F2a/BAHNHOFPLATZ/01.04:02"
13;Schützenfesthalle;"During the summer of 1901, the 37th Eidgenössische Schützenfest took place in Lucerne. For this purpose, a wooden hall was created on the Bahnhofplatz. After the festivities, the building housed the War and Peace Museum, which opened its doors on June 7, 1902. The museum stayed here until it moved into its new location at Museggstrasse. From 1911, a roller skating rink was built by the Kurkommittee. The hall was closed in the fall of 1930 to make space for the Art and Congress Centre designed by Armin Meili.";8.31153041;47.0505828;13_F2a_BAHNHOFPLATZ_0_13-02-D.jpeg;"Photographer unknown, ca. 1905, F2a/BAHNHOFPLATZ/0.13:02"
